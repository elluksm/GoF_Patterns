# GoF_Patterns

A simple Java application about Gardening. 
Here you can create vegeteables, iterate through insects in the vegetable garden and initialize gardeners. 
You can also broadcast messages to the gardeners to give them gardening advices or warnings.

  5 GOF patterns are implemented in this solution:
  - Factory method (creational pattern)
  - Template method (behavioral pattern)
  - Iterator Pattern (behavioral pattern)
  - Decorator (structural pattern)
  - Observer (behavioral pattern)
